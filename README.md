Multicrop
===========
Purpose
------
I frequently need to take several screenshots of a constant portion of my screen. This program prevents needing to meticulously crop the same area from each image individually. Multicrop allows you to select the cropping area only once on a single image and have it be applied to it and all other selected images.

Usage
------
The statusbar along the bottom guides you through the process.

1. Click "Open"
2. Select image(s) to crop. Hold down command/ctrl to select multiple.
3. The first of the selected images is displayed. Select a rectangular region on the image to crop
4. Click "Crop"
5. Repeat steps 3/4 until happy with the result. Then click "Save All"

All selected images will be cropped and saved with the prefix "Multicropped-".
